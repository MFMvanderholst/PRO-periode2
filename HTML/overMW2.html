                <h2>Maps</h2>
                <p>
                    Modern Warfare II features two map types: Core Maps and Battle Maps. These maps are grouped into one of three categories: Al Mazrah, Las Almas, and the Rest of the World.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Al Mazrah: Maps in this category are based on locations in Al Mazrah, a metropolitan area and its outskirts within the Republic of Adal serving as the main region for Call of Duty®: Warzone™ 2.0. Several Core and Battle Maps will be based on locales from this region, making Multiplayer a great mode to get familiar with their points of interest and power positions.</li><br>
                        <li>Las Almas: A major area of interest in the Modern Warfare II Campaign, Las Almas is a Central American region that will host a variety of Core and Battle Maps.</li><br>
                        <li>Rest of the World: The final category of maps takes place in areas outside of Al Mazrah and Las Almas for a glimpse at what’s happening in other regions of the world.</li><br>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <br><p>Core Maps support traditional 6v6 play while Battle Maps support up to 32v32.<br></p>

                <h2>Gamemodes</h2>
                <p>
                    Modern Warfare II Multiplayer offers two distinct mode categories at launch, based on the type of map they are played on: Core Map modes and Battle Map modes. These are all the modes:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Free-for-All: Eliminate everyone. The first player to reach 30 eliminations ends the match, with the top three performers claiming victory.</li>
                        <li>Team Deathmatch: Call of Duty® in its purest form. Use teamwork to eliminate enemy players and reach the score limit. The first team to obtain 75 eliminations wins the match. </li>
                        <li>Domination: Compete for control of three zones marked by flags — A, B, and C. Captured zones accrue points over the course of one round. The first team to reach 200 points wins the match.</li>
                        <li>Hardpoint: Capture the Hardpoint and hold it against attack. The Hardpoint location rotates every minute, with the position of the next Hardpoint being indicated in the last 10 seconds of the previous zone. The first team to earn 250 points wins the match.</li>
                        <li>Headquarters: Work to capture the Headquarters, then dig in and defend. Respawns are disabled for the team that holds the HQ. Once the HQ is taken offline, a new zone is designated for the next one. The first team to earn 200 points wins the match. </li>
                        <li>Control: Take turns attacking and defending two objectives. Each team shares a pool of 30 lives. If the attacking team successfully takes out one objective, they will gain more time to complete the second. The defending team can win the round by letting the time run out before the objectives are taken. Either team can additionally win by eliminating all 30 lives of the other team. The first team to win three rounds wins the match.</li>
                        <li>Prisoner Rescue: Locate the hostages and get them out alive or prevent their extraction at all costs. No respawns. Team revives are enabled. The Attackers must find two hostages and carry them either out or protect at the extraction point – each hostage is worth 100 points. Defenders must prevent their extraction at all costs and hold them together in their spawn area until the round’s timer expires –  each hostage not carried nor captured by the attackers are worth 50 points. The first team to earn 500 points wins the match.</li>
                        <li>Knock Out: Both teams fight over a bag of Cash located in the middle of the map. No respawns. Team revives are enabled. Run over the Cash to grab it. The team that holds the bag at the end of the round or that eliminates the entire enemy team wins the round. The first team to take five rounds wins the match.</li>
                        <li>Search & Destroy: Teams take turns defending and destroying an objective. No respawning. Attackers win a round by eliminating all defenders before or after the bomb is planted, or successfully planting a bomb and having it explode. Defenders win a round by eliminating all attackers before the bomb is planted, by not allowing the bomb to be planted within the round’s time limit, or by defusing the bomb once it is planted. The first team to take six rounds wins the match.</li>
                        <li>Ground War: Two teams, each composed of 32 players, square off to capture an odd number of objectives on a large map. This is a supersized version of Domination, including vehicles for epic brawls. The first team to earn 250 points wins the match.</li>
                        <li>Ground War Invasion: A massive chaotic battle with a mix of players and AI fighting alongside each other. Utilize vehicles, Killstreak crates, and armored agents to gain the advantage over your opponent. The first team to reach 2,000 points wins the match.</li>
